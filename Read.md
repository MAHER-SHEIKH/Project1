# Simple Python Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of Python programming by creating a simple script.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor).

## Steps to Create the Project

1. **Create a New Python File**  
    Save a new file with the `.py` extension, e.g., `simple_project.py`.

2. **Write the Code**  
    Add the following code to your file:
    ```python
    # Simple Python Program: Greeting User
    def greet_user(name):
         print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the Python project.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
         user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
         greet_user(user_name)
    ```

3. **Run the Script**  
    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the file's directory, and run:
    ```bash
    python simple_project.py
    ```

4. **Test the Program**  
    Enter your name when prompted and verify the output.

## Customization
- Modify the greeting message to personalize it.
- Add additional functionality, such as asking for the user's age or favorite color.

## Conclusion
This project is a starting point to explore Python programming. Experiment with the code to learn more!
